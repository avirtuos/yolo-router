# yolo-router

A discrete-event simulation (SimPy) that models two load-balancing architectures and their scaling behaviors under configurable traffic:

- Round Robin (RR)
- Least Connections (LC)

The simulation uses simulated time only (SimPy `env.now`/`env.timeout`), never wall-clock time. Metrics are captured in an event-driven way at every load balancing decision.

## Quickstart

1) Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2) Run one of the example scenarios:
```
# Round Robin
python -m yolo_router --config configs/example_round_robin.json

# Least Connections
python -m yolo_router --config configs/example_least_conns.json
```

3) Find the reports:
- JSON: `reports/<scenario>/report.json`
- Markdown: `reports/<scenario>/report.md`

4) CLI overrides (optional):
- `--arch round_robin|least_conns` override architecture
- `--seed <int>` set RNG seed for reproducibility
- `--output-dir <path>` change output directory

Example:
```
python -m yolo_router --config configs/example_round_robin.json --seed 999 --output-dir out/rr
```

## Configuration

Provide a JSON config file. The examples in `configs/` are good starting points.

Top-level sections:

- `simulation`
  - `seed` (int): RNG seed
  - `duration_ms` (int): simulated time to generate arrivals
  - `drain_ms` (int): time to allow in-flight requests to complete after generation stops

  "reporting": { "output_dir": "reports/round_robin", "writers": ["json", "markdown"] }
}
```

## What the reports show

Reports are generated at the end of the run:

- Retries histogram: counts how many requests required 0, 1, 2, ... retries.
- Percentiles (p100, p99, p90, p80, p50) for:
  - Per-target concurrent requests (from decision-time snapshots)
  - Per-target CPU utilization (from decision-time snapshots)
  - Request durations (service time on target)
  - End-to-end request latencies (LB arrival to completion)
- Fleet size percentiles (from decision-time snapshots)
- Per-target metrics (JSON and Markdown):
  - total_requests handled by each target
  - Percentiles for concurrency, CPU utilization, request duration, and latency

Notes:
- Sampling is event-driven at every load-balancing decision, reflecting state at decision boundaries.
- All times are simulated time (ms). No wall-clock (e.g. `time.time()`/`sleep`) is used.

## Key classes and functions (yolo_router/cli.py)

- Simulation driver
  - `class Simulation`: orchestrates the entire run
    - Initializes SimPy `env`, RNG, Topology, ScalingService, LB hosts, and targets
    - Request generator process samples inter-arrival times and submits requests to randomly chosen LB hosts
    - `run()`: advances simulated time, drains, and returns the report dict
- Traffic and request
  - `class Request`: request attributes (arrival time, duration, cpu_demand, retries, start/end times, chosen target)
  - Sampling helpers (functions) for arrival, duration, and cpu_demand distributions
- Targets and topology
  - `class Target`: accepts/denies requests based on `max_concurrency`; starts a service process; tracks current concurrency and CPU utilization; updates metrics on completion
  - `class Topology`: holds `Target` instances, manages IDs, broadcasts topology changes to LB hosts
- Scaling
  - `class ScalingService`: SimPy processes for `scale_up` and `scale_down` with configured delays; enforces `min_targets`/`max_targets`
- Load balancers
  - `class LBHostBase`: base class for LB hosts; defines the snapshot mechanism invoked after decisions
  - `class RoundRobinLBHost`:
    - Maintains per-host local list of targets and round-robin index
    - On rejection, retries up to `retry_limit`; then scales up if needed
    - Propagates topology changes to other hosts after `sync_delay_ms` (initiator learns immediately)
    - Periodic (sim-time) scan for idle targets to scale down
  - `class SharedLeastConnsState`: shared outstanding count map protected by a `simpy.Resource` mutex; methods update counts with optional lock latency
  - `class LeastConnsLBHost`:
    - Atomically selects target with the least outstanding requests under `max_concurrency`
    - If none available, scales up and routes to new target (updating shared state)
    - Tracks completion via shared state; also performs idle scale-down scans
- Metrics and reporting
  - `class MetricsCollector`:
    - Request-level metrics: retries, latencies, service durations
    - Event-driven snapshots after each LB decision: fleet size, per-target concurrency, per-target CPU utilization
    - Per-target aggregates: request counts and percentiles for concurrency, CPU utilization, durations, and latencies
    - `build_report()`: returns a dict consumed by writers
    - `report_markdown(report)`: returns a Markdown string
- CLI
  - `main(argv=None)`: parses arguments, loads/merges config, runs `Simulation`, writes JSON/Markdown reports

## Modeling notes

- Simulated time:
  - All timers/delays use `env.timeout(ms)` and `env.now` (ms). The 5-minute idle windows are based on simulated ms.
- Event-driven sampling:
  - Snapshots happen after every LB decision: accept, reject (before retry), and scale-then-route.
- RR propagation:
  - When scaling changes occur, the initiating host updates its local view immediately; others receive updates after `sync_delay_ms`.
- LC atomicity:
  - Target selection and outstanding count updates are protected by a single-capacity `simpy.Resource` to model a shared, consistent view.

## Reproducibility

- Set `simulation.seed` in config or `--seed` via CLI to get repeatable runs.

## Troubleshooting

- Missing dependencies:
  - Ensure you are in the virtual environment and ran `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- No reports:
  - Check that the configured `reporting.output_dir` is writable
  - Ensure the simulation `duration_ms` is non-zero and traffic arrival rate is reasonable
